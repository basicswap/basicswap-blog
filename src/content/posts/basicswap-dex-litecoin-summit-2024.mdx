We're excited to announce that Particl and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap will be taking the stage at the [Litecoin Summit 2024](https://litecoin.net/summit) in Nashville this summer, happening on July 24-25.

Litecoin Foundation proudly presents the 4th annual Litecoin Summit at Margaritaville Hotel Nashville! Tickets now available.

His talk will focus on the significant privacy and freedom benefits associated with using MWEB-powered Litecoin swaps on BasicSwap DEX, why this combination of leading-edge technologies is particularly meaningful against the backdrop of current cryptocurrency and global events, and how it solidifies Litecoin's role as a leading cryptocurrency moving forward.

If you're in or around Nashville during the summit, we invite you to join us as it's shaping up to be one of the standout conferences of the year.
