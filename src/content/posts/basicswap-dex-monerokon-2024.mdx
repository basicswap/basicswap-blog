Last week, BasicSwap DEX was prominently featured at this year's edition of Monerokon, in Pragues. Throughout the weekend, two BasicSwap-related presentations were given. The first was a workshop on setting up, using, and maximizing the benefits of the DEX, while the second focused on the underlying technology, specifically the decentralized SecureMessaging (SMSG) data and messaging network.

If you missed the live stream, you can watch the presentation on Monerokon's YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6B5xtWrohw) or via the embedded media player below.
