There is a mandatory Firo Core update ahead of their upcoming hardfork on block 1,104,500 (approximately 28 May 2025). This update introduces several updates to Firo, but most notably the introduction of Spark Names, "allowing users to register unique, easy-to-remember aliases instead of long cryptographic addresses".

<Callout type="info" title="Spark Names Introduction">
  This new core update is now available to users who have updated their BasicSwap instance to the latest version, and you must update your Firo node as soon as possible if you've enabled the coin on your local instance.

# Update Coin Cores on BasicSwap‚Äå

To update coin cores on BasicSwap DEX, simply follow the instructions available here on the Particl Academy.

1.  Shutdown BasicSwap properly and stop the Docker image.
2.  From the basicswap folder, type the `git pull` command.
3.  Type the relevant update command, depending whether you're running BasicSwap with or without Docker (see [here](https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/user-guides/update)).
4.  If you run BasicSwap on Linux without Docker, you can easily upgrade coin cores to their most recent version by running the community-built upgrade script available [here](https://github.com/nahuhh/basicswap-bash/releases) (bsx-update).
