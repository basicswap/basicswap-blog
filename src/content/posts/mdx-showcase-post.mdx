Welcome to the BasicSwap DEX Blog, the new home for BasicSwap-related content! We're migrating to this new platform to provide a central point of reference for all BasicSwap-related communications and to give you a better experience by better organizing and presenting the content.

On here, you'll find the latest updates, insights, and announcements from BasicSwap contributors, as well as release blog posts for all major BasicSwap releases.

Starting today, all new BasicSwap-related blog posts will be published on this new platform exclusively. Previous articles will remain available on Particl News under the BasicSwap tag, but will no longer be updated or maintained.

# New Capabilities

The new BasicSwap DEX Blog is built using Next.js and MDX. Posts are written in Markdown and converted to HTML using MDX, and then rendered on the client-side using React. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling, but MDX also supports custom components and other styling options, making this new platform much more flexible and powerful.

## Blog Architecture

This particular architecture allows for the use of MDX to create interactive blog posts, such as charts, tables, and interactive components, making content much more engaging and dynamic as well as providing more flexibility in terms of styling and layout to authors

To highlight these new capabilities, we're publishing this blog post as a reference for other BasicSwap contributors who may want to publish on this blog and leverage all of its new features. As such, this blog post may be less of a BasicSwap-specific post, but rather a general guide on how to use MDX to create dynamic and interactive posts.

# Standard Markdown Still Works!

Let's start with the basics. You can still use all your favorite Markdown syntax, including: *italic*, **bold**, ~~strikethrough~~, <u>underline</u>, and `code text` words.

## Bullet Points with Nested Lists

-   Item 1
-   Item 2
    -   Sub-item A
    -   Sub-item B

## Numbered Lists

1.  First step
2.  Second step

## Code Blocks with Syntax Highlighting
```javascript
// Code blocks are also supported with syntax highlighting
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet("MDX");
```

```python
# Python example
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))
```

```bash
# Bash example
echo "Hello, World!"
ls -l
```

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.

## Horizontal Rules

# Custom Components in Action

MDX allows you to import and use custom React components directly within your Markdown content. This opens up a lot of possibilities for creating dynamic and interactive blog posts.

## Callouts

Here's an example of a callout components for important information:

<Callout type="info" title="Important Announcement">
  This is a special message highlighting a key point in our blog post.
  It uses a custom React component imported directly into MDX.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Warning: Proceed with Caution">
  This is a warning message. Be careful when implementing the following steps.
</Callout>

<Callout type="pro-tip" title="Pro Tip: Optimize Performance">
  For better performance, consider lazy loading components and images.
</Callout>

<Callout type="resource" title="Resource: MDX Documentation">
  Find more information about MDX capabilities in the official [MDX documentation](https://mdxjs.com/).
</Callout>

## Dynamic Content with JavaScript

You can also embed JavaScript expressions directly within your Markdown content. This can be used for dynamic dates, conditional rendering, or other calculations:

The current year is: **{new Date().getFullYear()}**.

Here's a random number: **{Math.random().toFixed(4)}** (will change if you refresh the page).

## Structured Data with Styled Tables

For presenting tabular data, you can use custom styled table components.

<StyledTableWrapper><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Supported</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Custom Components</td><td>Yes</td><td>Import and use any React component.</td></tr><tr><td>Charts</td><td>Yes</td><td>Requires Chart.js or similar.</td></tr><tr><td>JS Expressions</td><td>Yes</td><td>For dynamic content.</td></tr><tr><td>Collapsible Menus</td><td>Yes</td><td>Requires custom component.</td></tr></tbody></StyledTableWrapper>

## Data Visualization with Charts

You can embed interactive charts to present data clearly. While what's displayed here is a static example, you can absolutely embed dynamic charts with live data!

<ChartWrapper type="bar" data={{ labels: ['Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4'], datasets: [{ label: 'Project Growth', data: [10, 25, 15, 30], backgroundColor: 'rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.5)' }] }} />

### Here's a dynamic chart with live data:

<ChartWrapper type="line" dataType="bitcoin-transactions" />

# Interactive Elements 

## Collapsible Elements

<Collapsible title="Click to reveal a secret message!">
  <p>You found it! BasicSwap is awesome!</p>
</Collapsible>

## Custom Divs

<CustomDiv className="bg-green-100 text-green-800 p-4 rounded-md mt-4">
  This is a custom styled div, demonstrating exotic styling possibilities.
</CustomDiv>

## Interactive Components

Here's an example of an interactive React component embedded directly into MDX:

<Counter />

## Development Checklist

Here's a sample checklist to track development progress (e.g., tasks, bugs, and features that contributors are working on):

<Checklist items={[
  { id: 'task-1', text: 'Implement core features', completed: true },
  { id: 'task-2', text: 'Write unit tests', completed: false },
  { id: 'task-3', text: 'Deploy to staging', completed: false },
  { id: 'task-4', text: 'Gather user feedback', completed: false },
]} />

## Project Roadmap

You can even generate components with more advanced functionality, such as timelines or roadmaps:

<Timeline items={[
  { date: 'Q1 2025', title: 'Phase 1: Core Development', description: 'Initial setup, basic features, and infrastructure.' },
  { date: 'Q2 2025', title: 'Phase 2: Feature Expansion', description: 'Adding advanced features and user-facing functionalities.' },
  { date: 'Q3 2025', title: 'Phase 3: Optimization & Testing', description: 'Performance improvements, extensive testing, and bug fixes.' },
  { date: 'Q4 2025', title: 'Phase 4: Public Launch', description: 'Official release and continuous support.' },
]} />
