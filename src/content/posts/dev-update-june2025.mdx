Welcome to the June 2025 BasicSwap DEX progress report! This new progress report format provides a detailed and structured overview of recent developments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors, updated dynamically throughout the month.

It aims to be more informative than previous weekly progress reports, with less frequent but more substantial updates. Each post is scheduled based on release cycles rather than fixed intervals.

# Last Month's Recap: May 2025

Here’s a detailed breakdown of what we’ve accomplished last month.

## Releases

<UrlPreviewCard url="https://particl.news/mandatory-firo-core-update-may2025/" />

Last month saw only a minor release of BasicSwap, though it was mandatory for users running a Firo node. This release enables you to update your Firo Core to the latest version (v0.14.14.1), which is required following their recent hard fork. 

The release also incorporates various minor bug fixes and improvements to BasicSwap, making it recommended for all users, as is standard with all releases. 

The next major iteration of BasicSwap will be released in the coming weeks and will feature more significant additions, including automated market making/advanced order management and multi-network support (MVP). 

## Major Features

### Multi-net Support

<UrlPreviewCard url="https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310" />

* **Consult the 40 related commits on the AMM pull request:** https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310/commits

We've deployed the MVP of a significant infrastructure update to BasicSwap's networking architecture. This new feature, called "multi-net," enables BasicSwap to distribute swap, offer, and bid messages across multiple messaging networks beyond SMSG when the primary network experiences high load.

Since all messages will adhere to a unified encryption and formatting standard once fully complete, even non-decentralized networks (such as Telegram or email) could be utilized without compromising user privacy or security.

This new functionality delivers several key benefits:

1. Improved platform scalability and resilience;
2. Greater flexibility for third-party integrations, allowing partners to use their preferred compatible networks for relaying messages;
3. Cross-network message compatibility, eliminating the need for users to operate on the same network during swaps.

While the foundation is now in place, further development is still needed before the implementation can be considered complete. The current MVP uses Simplex to broadcast messages, but we intend on adding support for more networks as we progress in time.

The core architecture is designed to extend SMSG functionality across various networks. All messages maintain SMSG encryption and message IDs for consistency, although additional work is required to ensure full compatibility of Python SMSG messages across all networks and to add convenience functions for submitting pre-formed SMSG messages.

Not to be overlooked is the important advantage of this approach in its flexibility regarding network requirements. Since all messages, regardless of which network was used to relay them, will be fully valid SMSG entities, they can be transmitted over plaintext networks like Telegram, Delta, or even IRC. Email systems supporting POP3/IMAP protocols are particularly well-suited for more decentralization-focused users. It's worth noting that centralized options, including Simplex, may still expose some information pseudonymously about which accounts are communicating with each other.

<Callout type="info" title="MVP Status">
  Note that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all the bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it is currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the user interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to happen when two participants are on a different network.

  The latter will require modifications to Particl Core via a hardfork, which we are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network emission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS proposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.
</Callout>

### Automated Market Making and Advanced Order Management

<UrlPreviewCard url="https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311" />

* **Consult the 11 related commits on the AMM pull request:** https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311/commits

Although BasicSwap has featured two companion scripts for market making and advanced order management for some time, they have operated separately from the main application and required independent execution via terminal commands.

Last month, we developed and successfully deployed, on the `dev` branch, a new page that will integrate these functionalities directly into the user interface. This enables users to perform market making and advanced trading operations directly from the main interface without running additional scripts.

These features are now available on a dedicated AMM page to ensure a smooth integration, but in a second phase, we plan to incorporate some of these capabilities directly into the regular new offer workflow.

As it stands at this moment, the initial implementation is now ready and live on the `dev` branch, and a new BasicSwap page connects directly with the automated market making companion script, allowing you to interact with it directly from the user interface. This means you can deploy it, edit its configuration, and post offers using advanced trading options — such as automatic republishing, automatic fiat spread adjustment, price pegging, and more — straight from the user interface. 

The initial AMM implementation is thus expected to go live on the next production build.

# This Month's Focus: June 2025

## Summary

Coming into June with momentum from our successful presence at the 2025 Litecoin Summit, BasicSwap contributors are focusing on larger features and improvements than usual.

As we progress through BasicSwap's Monero CCS proposal, we've successfully rolled out several releases that addressed the initial proposal points, which primarily aimed at improving BasicSwap's core functionalities before moving to more ambitious and user-facing features.

With the core codebase now satisfyingly solid and stable, we've begun focusing on more advanced and user-facing improvements with specific attention to accessibility and usability — a bid to make atomic swap technology ubiquitous and as accessible as other types of crypto exchanges, including centralized exchanges.

# Community & Events

## Events

### 2025 Litecoin Summit

The 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored to be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an excellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as accessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing the user experience of centralized exchanges.

Part of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a protocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as Litecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.

While we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the milestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the next phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at the Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide much-needed liquidity to the order book.

Be sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:

<YouTube videoId="yP-cXP7aUnQ" />

Additionally, Dr. Kap participated in the "Panel on Privacy" with industry leaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin Berman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and Marketing at Dash).
